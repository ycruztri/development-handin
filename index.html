            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Amazon’s aggregator usage and recommendation features are good, as it provides a seamless shopping experience 
                with easy access to the shopping cart and personalized recommendations. Pinterest stands out with its visually 
                appealing board system and collaborative features, although improving access to favorited items could enhance usability. 
                Etsy integrates favoriting seamlessly into product listings but could improve access and visibility of favorited items 
                for a better user experience.</p>
